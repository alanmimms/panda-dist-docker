The Panda monitor supports two-unit RP07 structures.  Although TOPS-20 can
be modified to support four-unit RP07 structures fairly easily, or 16-unit
RP07 structures with somewhat more work, doing so renders *all* structures
created by the monitor incompatible with a DEC monitor, including small
structures.  The benefit of the two-unit patch is that single-unit RP07
structures remain compatible with the DEC monitor.

You can not create a multi-unit RP07 structure with a DEC monitor, which
includes the monitor on the installation tape.  You'll know that you made
this mistake if you get a BTBCRT bughlt from a 143 start and specified two
RP07 units.  Either you have to make your own installation tape with the
Panda MONITR.EXE, or you have to make the structure using CHECKD while
running a Panda monitor.

Since this distribution comes with a pre-built Panda system on a single-unit
RP07 structure, you shouldn't need to use the installation tape at all (and
you probably don't want to, since the installation tape has none of the
Panda changes!).  You can just create a new structure with CHECKD, copy the
files from your existing PS to the new structure (e.g. using MERLIN) then
boot from the new structure.

If you like living life in the fast lane, you can also conver the single-unit
RP07 PS to a two-units PS with a 143 start.  Answer "no" to the "replace"
command, "yes" to the define command, and make sure that you give the same
sizes for swap area and bootstrap that were there before.  Once its defined,
then run CHECKD and have it rebuild the bittable.  If you did everything just
right, you would have added the new disk without clobbering anything.

The procedure in the previous paragraph is not for the faint of heart.

Note that the changes to do two-unit RP07 structures involve changes to
the monitor, to CHECKD, and to BOOT.
